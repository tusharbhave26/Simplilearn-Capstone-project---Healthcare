# Simplilearn-Capstone-project---Healthcare
This is a machine learning project related to the healthcare industry. In this we try to predict whether the patient in the dataset have diabetes or not \n


This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
